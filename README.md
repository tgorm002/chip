#CS120B Final Project

## The Project: Memory
Memory is a game based around testing the userâ€™s memory and how well they can remember patterns. The player will see 4 lights in port b in a diamond shape. When the user moves the joystick in any direction game will start and a single light will light up, turn off, and another light will turn on in random order. This will happen 4 times. The program will remember what 4 lights turned on and in what order and then the player must move the joystick in the direction and order that the lights lit up. If this was the right order all the lights will light up and the LED matrix will light up in a snake-like fashion. If the player got it wrong then the middle light in the diamond will light up and the LED matrix will display an X. The game will sit in a wait state until the user moves the joystick to start the next round. If the user got the last 4 right, the next round will be 5 lights lighting up in a random order, and so on. If the user gets it wrong, the game resets to 4 lights again. This can go up to level 100.

## The Code
All of the code that I have written can be found first within the lab folder, and then within the source folder.
